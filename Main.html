                    <p>Döner has its roots in Ottoman-era Turkey, where the concept of cooking meat on a vertical rotisserie was popularized. Iskender Kebab, on the other hand, was created in the city of Bursa by Iskender Efendi in the 19th century. Both dishes are iconic examples of Turkish cuisine, with döner representing convenient street food, while Iskender offers a more indulgent twist.</p>

                    <p> In Portugal, one of the most iconic chicken dishes is "Frango Piri-Piri," also known as Portuguese Piri-Piri chicken. This flavorful dish originated in the former Portuguese colonies in Africa, particularly in Mozambique and Angola, where the use of spicy Piri-Piri peppers was prevalent. Portuguese explorers and settlers brought this spicy chili pepper back to Portugal, where it was incorporated into various dishes. Over time, it became a key ingredient in the marinade for grilled or roasted chicken. The chicken is marinated in a mixture of Piri-Piri sauce, garlic, olive oil, and other seasonings, then grilled to perfection. The result is a succulent, spicy, and aromatic chicken dish that has become a beloved part of Portuguese cuisine.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Place the duck in your largest pan.</li>
                        <li>Cover the duck with water.</li>
                        <li>Add coriander, bay leaves, thyme, star anise, leek top, onion, carrot, orange zest, and a grinding of black pepper to the pan.</li>
                        <li>Put the pan over medium heat and bring it to a boil. Be sure to skim off any scum from the surface.</li>
                        <li>Reduce the heat slightly, cover the pan, and simmer for 45 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Turn off the heat and let the duck cool in the stock for 15 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Drain the stock from the duck, but reserve it for cooking the rice.</li>
                        <li>Allow the duck to rest until it's cool enough to handle, then shred the meat away from the bone.</li>
