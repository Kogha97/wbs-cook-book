        <h3>About-Dish</h3>
        <p>The Story of Iskender Kebab
            The story of İskender Kebab, one of the famous dishes of the Bursa region, began in 1867 in the shop of Mehmet's son İskender Efendi in Bursa Kayhan.
            
            Until the second half of the 19th century, lamb was cooked by laying it on a wood-burning stove parallel to the ground. In this method, constantly turning the lamb required excessive labor and did not cook the meat evenly on all sides. It was also very difficult to equally share the different flavors of different parts of the lamb with the customers. Of course, the smell and smoke created by the lamb lying horizontally on the fire and its fat dripping onto the coals were also disturbing.</p></div>
    
    
         <div class="Recepie-Döner">
          <h3>Recepie</h3>
          <p> Cut the pitas into small squares and lightly fry them with 1 tablespoon of butter.
            In a separate pan, roast the meat doner kebabs with 1 tablespoon of butter for 4 minutes.
            Put 1.5 cups of tomato juice and 1 tablespoon of butter in a sauce pot and cook until it boils and thickens.
            Place the toasted bread on a serving plate.
            Roasted doner kebabs are placed on the bread.
            Tomato sauce is poured over the doner kebabs.
            Finally, 2 tablespoons of butter are fried in a separate pan and poured over it. Bon appetit to those who will try it.</p></div>

                It is possible to see meatballs among the Ottoman palace dishes in the 16th century. 
                "Meatballs and special bread" were among the dishes served to the guests at the banquets held at the circumcision wedding of Prince Bayezid and Prince Cihangir, sons of Suleiman the Magnificent, in November 1539.</p></div>

              <p> Let's put our minced meat into a suitable kneading bowl. Let's add grated and squeezed onion, small cut garlic, egg, bread crumbs, oil, parsley, salt, black pepper and cumin and knead until our ingredients are mixed well.
                Let's cover the mixture we prepared with stretch wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
                At the end of the time, let's take our mortar from the fridge and shape it by tearing off pieces with our hands. I made the shape oval, but you can shape it as you wish. However, you should make sure that the inside of your meatballs are thin so that they can be cooked.
                Let's put the meatballs we shaped into a suitable plate. If you wish, you can rest your meatballs at this stage.
                To cook our meatballs, let's take oil in our pan on the stove and heat it.
                Then, let's put our meatballs into our pan and cook them by turning them on both sides.

                It is generally accepted that this dish was carried by the Turks and Mongols from Central Asia to Anatolia along the Silk Road. 
                According to Holly Chase, Turkish and Mongolian horsemen carried frozen or absence manti with them during their migrations. 
                Turkish and Mongolian troops could prepare manti to be eaten over a campfire.
                 According to an Armenian researcher, it began to become extinct in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia as a result of cultural interaction between Armenians and Mongols in the 13th century. In Anatolia, the name of the dish has changed to manti.

              <p> Let's add 3.5 cups of flour and 1 teaspoon of salt to a deep mixing bowl.
                Let's mix and make a hole in the middle of the flour.
                Let's add 1 egg to the middle and continue mixing.
                Let's add 1 glass of warm water slowly while mixing.
                Let's knead the dough until it reaches a consistency that is neither too hard nor soft.
                Let's cover the ready dough with stretch film and let it rest.
                While the dough is resting, let's add 250 grams of low-fat minced meat to a suitable mixing bowl.
                Then, add 1 medium-sized onion, half a teaspoon of black pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of chili pepper and mix well.
                Let's put the dough on the counter sprinkled with flour and knead the dough together. Let's divide the dough into 3 equal parts.
                Let's turn the dough we separated into pieces. Let's roll out the meringues we prepared on the flour-sprinkled counter, one by one, with a rolling pin so that they are thicker than dough.
                Let's cut the rolled out dough into small squares with a knife. Let's put small pieces of the minced meat mixture we prepared in the middle of the squares we cut.

                In 1977, Lee Lantz, a fish merchant from Los Angeles, was 5,000 miles away scouring the days catch at the largest port in Chile, looking for something new to sell back home.
                Nothing looked exciting. 
                Lantz was about to give up when he saw it: a giant gray-black fish that could grow to more than seven feet long, with a gaping mouth rimmed by a row of sharp teeth.
                It was fat and…prehistoric.
                The locals called it “bacalao de profundidad,” according to G. Bruce Knecht s book Hooked about the fish s rise to fame and later troubles. 
                The name, Knecht writes, translates to “cod of the deep.” Fishermen caught it by accident and often had trouble selling it. 
                The rest of the English-speaking world knew it as Patagonian toothfish, though few chefs had heard of it at all.</p></div>

              <p> Season the inside of the fish with salt, pepper, lemon slices and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Season the outside with salt and pepper.
                Heat your grill up to medium if using propane, and adjust the coals to one side if using charcoal.
                Place the fish on the cooler side of the grill and cook 6-8 minutes per side until the flesh turns translucent.
                Cut the lemon in half and grill over high heat, use to garnish your plate.</p></div>

                Rotisserie chicken has become a growing trend in the United States since the mid 1990s. American supermarkets commonly roast rotisserie chickens using either horizontal or vertical rotisseries. These chickens are a means of using unsold fresh chickens and are often sold at lower prices than fresh chickens. Wholesale club Costco does not recycle fresh chickens but is noted for selling 60 million of its US$4.99 whole roasted chickens each year.The Boston Market fast casual restaurant chain originally specialized in roast chicken.</p></div>

                Preheat the oven to 210°c/Gas mark 7.
                Remove the chicken giblets.
                Rinse the chicken inside and out. 
                Remove any excess fat and leftover pin feathers and pat the outside dry.
                Liberally salt and pepper the inside of the chicken.
                Stuff the cavity with the bunch of thyme, both halves of lemon, and all the garlic.
                Brush the outside of the chicken with the butter and sprinkle again with salt and pepper.
                Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the chicken.
                Place the onions, carrots, and fennel in a roasting pan. Toss with salt, pepper, 20 sprigs of thyme, and olive oil.
                Spread around the bottom of the roasting pan and place the chicken on top.
                Roast the chicken for 1 1/2 hours, or until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and thigh.
                Remove the chicken and vegetables to a platter and cover with aluminium foil for about 20 minutes.

                Duck rice is a Singaporean dish made of either braised or roasted duck and plain white rice.
                The braised duck is usually cooked with yam and shrimps; it can be served simply with plain white rice and a thick dark sauce; side dishes of braised hard-boiled eggs, preserved salted vegetables, or hard beancurd may be added.
                In addition, the Teochew based boneless duck rice is a similar, but a more refined dish; due to the slightly tougher texture of duck, the duck is artfully deboned and sliced thinly for the convenience and ease of the diner, allowing the sauces to seep into the meat; Singapore's Hainanese chicken rice and other similar dishes have followed this style due to the popularity.
                Along with chicken rice, this dish can commonly be found in hawker centres and food centers all over Singapore.</p></div>

              <p> Put the duck in your largest pan, cover with water and add the coriander, bay, thyme, star anise, leek top, onion, carrot, orange zest and a grinding of black pepper.
                 Place over a medium heat and bring to the boil, skimming off any scum from the surface. 
                 Turn down the heat slightly, cover and simmer for 45 mins, then turn off the heat and let the duck cool in the stock for 15 mins. 
                 Drain the stock from the duck, reserving it to cook the rice. Leave the duck to rest until cool enough to handle, then shred the meat away from the bone.
