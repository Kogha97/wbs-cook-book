            <li>1 cup red lentils </li>
            <li>1 medium sized onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon flour</li>

        <h3>About-Dish</h3>
        <p>Lentils have been unearthed in the Paleolithic and Mesolithic layers of Franchthi Cave in Greece (9,500 to 13,000 years ago), 
            at Mureybet and Tell Abu Hureyra in Syria at the end of the Mesolithic, and at Jericho, dating to 8000 BC.
            Remains of lentils have been found in royal tombs in the Theban Necropolis, dating to 2400 BC.
            Aristophanes called lentil soup "the most delicious of foods".
            The Roman cookbook Apicius, compiled in the 1st century AD, includes a recipe for lentil soup with chestnuts.</p></div>
    
    
         <div class="Recepie">
          <h3>Recepie</h3>
          <p> For the red lentil soup, put the oil in a pot and fry the chopped onions until they turn slightly pink.
            Then add flour and continue roasting over low heat.
            If tomato paste is to be used, add tomato paste. After it is roasted, diced carrots and thoroughly washed and drained lentils are added.
            Add water, mix and close the lid of the pot. Cook the soup over medium heat until it boils, then cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the lentils and carrots become soft.
            After the soup is cooked, crush it well with a hand blender. If you don't have a blender, you can also pass it through a strainer.
            Add black pepper, salt and optionally cumin and mix. Cook for another 5 minutes and remove from the stove.
            the consistency is too thick, add some water and boil it for a while.
            Meanwhile, put two tablespoons of butter in a small pan, heat it, add a teaspoon of red pepper powder and remove it from the stove.
            After the lentil soup is placed in a serving bowl, red pepper sauce is drizzled over it and served with a slice of lemon.</p></div>

            <h3>About-Dish</h3>
            <p>"Portuguese Garlic Prawns, known as 'Camarões à Alhinho,' tell the tale of coastal simplicity and flavor. Born in a seaside village, this dish marries fresh prawns with garlic, olive oil, and a touch of spice. As prawns sizzle in a fragrant garlic and wine sauce, it captures the essence of Portuguese coastal life, where the sea's bounty meets traditional cuisine, resulting in a delightful culinary experience."</p></div>
        
        
             <div class="Recepie-prawns">
              <h3>Recepie</h3>
              <p> Season the prawns with a pinch of salt and black pepper.
                In a large skillet or frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat. 
                Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Sauté for about 1-2 minutes, or until the garlic becomes fragrant and just starts to turn golden.
                Be careful not to burn the garlic.
                Increase the heat to medium-high and add the seasoned prawns to the skillet.
                Cook the prawns for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they turn pink and opaque.
                Pour in the white wine and cook for an additional 2 minutes, allowing the alcohol to evaporate and the sauce to reduce slightly.
                Sprinkle the chopped parsley over the prawns and toss them in the sauce to combine.
                Taste the dish and adjust the seasoning with more salt and black pepper if necessary.
                Serve the Portuguese Garlic Prawns hot, garnished with lemon wedges if desired.
                They are delicious on their own or with some crusty bread to soak up the flavorful garlic and wine sauce.</p></div>
