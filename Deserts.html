        <h3>About-Dish</h3>
        <p>Baklava, which has a place in the cuisine of many nations, is also embraced by many nations.
            Over time, it took its current form in Topkapi Palace.
            There are three theories about how today's baklava, which was first made in Topkapi Palace, originated.
            The first of these is that it derives from the placenta cake in Roman cuisine (later Byzantine cuisine).
            The second theory about the emergence of baklava is that it developed from the "layered bread" dish of the Central Asian Turks.
            The last theory is that the Persian dish lauizanaq evolved into baklava over time.

            First, let's prepare the sherbet for our dessert. For this, let's take sugar and water in a suitable pot.
            After mixing, let's let our syrup boil.
            At the end of the time, add lemon juice, boil for a few more minutes and remove from the stove.
            For the baklava dough, add the eggs, oil, milk, vinegar and salt into the kneading bowl and mix them.
            Then, add the flour slowly and knead the dough until it reaches a consistency that does not stick to the hand.
            Let's stretch the kneaded dough and let it rest for about 30 minutes. In this way, our dough will be rolled out much easier.
            At the end of the time, let's put our dough on the counter and knead it a few more times.
            Let's first divide our dough equally into 3 pieces, then divide each piece into 9 pieces.
            Let's knead the divided pieces from outside to inside, roll them in our hands and turn them into meringue. We will have 27 meringues in total.

            <h3>About-Dish</h3>
            <p>Sericaia is a typical sweet from the Portuguese region of Alentejo, probably of Indian origin due to the use of cinnamon, and is also known as Sericá or Cericá. It has signs of conventual sweets, in which eggs, sugar and cinnamon are used abundantly. It was implemented by the nuns of the convents of Elvas and Vila Viçosa, where the sweet is decorated with preserves from the region's famous plums. The touch of cinnamon and the fluffy texture make this sweet a true delight.

                It is a sweet that came to Brazil via Portugal, at the time of colonization according to Câmara Cascudo, in a text written in the 1960s, sericaia was popular in Brazil. It was a type of cream made from milk, sugar and eggs.</p></div>

              <p> Start by boiling the milk and the lemon peel. On the side, mix the sugar and the flour. Add the egg yolks and mix well.

                Add part of the milk to heat the egg yolk mixture and then add the remaining milk. Bring to the boil again to thicken (the same process as if for a custard cream).
                
                Let it partially cool. Then, mix the egg whiles whipped until firm. In a clay mould, greased with non-sticking spray, pour the mixture and sprinkle with cinnamon until the entire surface is covered.
                
                Cook in the oven at 220 ºC. After 10 minutes, with your fingers, make small holes in different points of the surface and let it cook for approximately 20 more minutes.
                
                Serve cold.</p></div>
